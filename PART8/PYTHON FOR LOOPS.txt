Python For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

---
1.py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
-----
NOTE: The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

---
Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:
2.py
for x in "banana":
  print(x) 
-----
The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
3.py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  if x == "banana":
    break
---------
Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:
4.py

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x) 
---------
The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:
5.py

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x) 
--------------------

The range() Function
6.py

for x in range(6):
  print(x) 


----

Using the start parameter:
7.py
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x) 

----------
Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

8.py
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x) 

-------------
Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:
9.py

for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
--------------
Nested Loops / Perulangan bersarang
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

10.py

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
